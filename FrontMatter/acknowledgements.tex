I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Christian Urban, for his guidance and support throughout
the project. His module on compilers sparked an interest in a topic that I had previously found
daunting. I would also like to thank my friends, Saif Latifi and Yusuf Yacoobali, for listening to
my ramblings when they probably had more important things to do. Finally, I would like to thank my
family for their support and encouragement throughout my studies.
